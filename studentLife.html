    			<h3><b>About the Learning Commons</b></h3>
    			<p>The Learning Commons, housed in the north wing of the Arnold Bernhard Library, is a centrally located academic support hub for the Quinnipiac community. It features space for tutoring and interactive learning, testing areas and meeting rooms for student and faculty presentations. Students have the ability to record presentations for peer critiques.</p>
    			<p>As a student at Quinnipiac, you'll take challenging courses that will help you develop into a lifelong learner. The Learning Commons is important to the process and should be part of every student's experience. We believe each student is an individual, bringing both strengths and weaknesses to any academic challenge. We also believe that intentional, active learning requires reflection. As a result, all of our programs are developed toward offering students many chances to reflect on not only what they are studying, but also how they are studying it.</p>
